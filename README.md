# Facebook Story Replies → Telegram “Human Required” Routing + Supabase CRM

This workflow automatically captures Facebook Story replies, normalizes incoming webhook payloads, stores them in Supabase, assigns them to the correct regional support team based on UTC time, and sends real-time notifications to Slack and Telegram.

This workflow listens to Facebook Story reply webhooks, converts raw payloads into a clean data structure, saves each reply in Supabase with a pending status, and automatically assigns it to the Asia or Europe support team based on the current UTC time. Once assigned, notifications are sent to Slack and Telegram, ensuring no customer reply is missed.

You receive:

*   **Real-time Facebook Story reply ingestion**
*   **Automatic support team assignment (Asia / Europe)**
*   **Centralized Supabase storage**
*   **Instant Slack & Telegram notifications**
*   **Alerts for replies outside support hours**

Ideal for support teams handling high volumes of social media interactions with strict response-time requirements.

### Quick Start – Implementation Steps

1.  Add your **Facebook Webhook** credentials and verify the callback URL.
2.  Connect **Supabase** credentials and confirm the replies table exists.
3.  Configure **UTC-based time window logic** for your support regions.
4.  Connect **Slack** credentials and select the notification channel.
5.  Add **Telegram Bot Token** and target chat ID.
6.  Activate the workflow — live reply handling starts instantly.
    
## What It Does

This workflow automates end-to-end handling of Facebook Story replies:

1.  Receives Story reply events from Facebook via webhook.
2.  Normalizes incoming payloads into a structured format.
3.  Stores replies in Supabase with a pending status.
4.  Checks current UTC time to identify the active support window.
5.  Assigns replies to Asia or Europe support teams.
6.  Updates reply status to assigned when routing succeeds.
7.  Sends notifications to Slack and Telegram.
8.  Raises alerts for replies outside support hours.
9.  Logs all actions for auditing and follow-up.

This ensures consistent handling, assignment, and visibility of customer interactions.
